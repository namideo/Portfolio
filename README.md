# Portfolio

## Assignment
For this project I started a portfolio page to showcase skills learned so far in html and css as well as to use as an actual portfolio upon entering the career world. As this will no doubt be improved on throughout the course, what I have presented is a starter code that adheres to the criteria within the assignment. 

## Criteria
1. In the header I have inserted my name and a list of links to my information which includes an "About Me", my work, and my contact information. I have also displayed these things in an aesthetically pleasing manner that is easy to read and distinguish. 
2. Each of the links correctly corresponds to its related section with the UI automatically scrolling to it. 
3. The "About Me" portion features a brief paragraph about myself as well as a profile picture. 
4. The "Work" segment features a large image, which also works as a link to my previous assignment working on the code-refactor. As it is the only work I have to show so far, I put it at the top followed by two place-holder images for the time being. The place-holder images are also smaller and staggered below the first image, as laid out in the criteria. Each image is correctly labeled. 
5. "Flex" has been added to the display in the css so as to make the page adaptable to different viewports.
6. My contact information has a place for a phone number and email as well as an actual link to my GitHub page.
